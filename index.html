      <p>My name is Nicholas Mahase. I currently work Full Time as a web developer for an automotive company, which sparked my
        interest in going back to school to become a Full Stack Developer.
        I decided this because it builds on my current educational back ground which is architecture.
        Drawing and developing plans for many different things.
        As a full stack developer I plan on exploring new opportunities within my company as well as exploring
        opportunities outside of the workplace.
      </p>
      <p>I am 29 years of age, residing in Ontario, happily married with many different interests and hobbies.
        I am Canadian born but was raised in the beautiful Caribbean country known as Trinidad and Tobago.
        While growing up in Trinidad and Tobago I learnt how to play and appreciated my first hobby which is cricket.
        I currently play cricket with many different teams here in Ontario in my spare time during the summer months.
        While living in Trinidad I also developed a love and passion for music.
        Through my religion and culture I learned how to play traditional instruments.
        With Trinidad being a such a multicultural country I listened to many different genres of music.
        As I got older my passion of music grew and I learned how to mix music and become a part time DJ.
